	<h4>How data is transmitted and stored</h4>

	<p>
		All data is transmitted encrypted via HTTPS. This includes passwords and session IDs. Session IDs are stored in cookies.
	</p>
	<p>
		All data is stored in plaintext, except passwords and session IDs. These are salted, peppered and hashed with SHA256 between 10000 and 20000 times (random number for each user). The result is stored. This same process is done again whenever a password or session ID is provided and the result is checked against the stored hashed values. As far as we're aware, this method means a breech of our database would not result in username/password combinations being obtainable through brute-forcing with current technology. Weak passwords are however easily obtainable no matter what encryption we use.

	<h4>Why data is stored</h4>

	<ul>
		<li>
			User IDs and usernames are stored to determine which user is related to each bit of content.
		</li>
		<li>
			Event dates and times, IP Addresses and User Agent information is stored to identify users in cases of abuse and user's level of activity.
		</li>
		<li>
			Usernames, password validation information, session IDs and the user's role are stored to authenticate and authorize users.
		</li>
		<li>
			Email addresses, Twitter handles, Bio, {{CONFIG.VALUES.THEME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} text, Cast vote, {{CONFIG.VALUES.GAME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} title, {{CONFIG.VALUES.GAME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} description, {{CONFIG.VALUES.GAME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} URLs, {{CONFIG.VALUES.GAME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} image, {{CONFIG.VALUES.GAME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} color, Voted for option and any other user-entered fields are considered voluntarily entered. Removing these fields (e.g. submitting them as blank) will (unless otherwise stated upon submission) remove them from public visibility, the old versions may however remain in logs or administrator-only tools. See "How can you control your data" for more details.
		</li>
		<li>
			For {{CONFIG.VALUES.THEME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} votes, poll votes and satisfaction votes, the cast votes are directly tied to the user who cast them. This is done to ensure each user can only cast one vote and to indicate to the user what they voted for. In the case of {{CONFIG.VALUES.THEME_PHRASE_SINGULAR}} votes, it is so we can color the currently-voted-for option. This is also done to mittigate cases of vote abuse or to check what different groups of users voted for - for example select only what recent participants voted for. This does mean that there is enough data available to check what each user individually has voted for ({{CONFIG.VALUES.THEME_PHRASE_PLURAL}}, polls and satisfaction).
		</li>
		<li>
			The data in the administration log is stored to identify abuse, determine administrator activity and to reverse accidental or malicious changes.
		</li>
		<li>
			The data in the administration candidate vote is stored to help determine which candidates should be given the administration role.
		</li>
	</ul>
